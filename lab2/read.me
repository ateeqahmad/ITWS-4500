This was a fun little experiment with the weather APIs. I decided using the html option the weather service uses would be too easy, as I could just shove it in, so I played with the JSON data and got things in just like in the example.

I also used bootstrap for the first time to get positioning and resizing, though I didn't delve too deep.

One thing I took away was that I should read the documentation more thoroughly, because I kept discovering the API did things I had put in extra work to do without me needing to do extra work. 

As a creativity bit I wanted to bring in my ticker from last time and tick through the next 15 days forecast, but I ended up not implementing that because I got carried away playing with bootstrap for our project.

I also implemented a temperture unit choosing thing, though that wasn't too complicated.
