#Quiz 1 -- Problem 2
Here is my simple webserver.

Run node server.js and then take a visit to http://localhost:3000 to see it work wonders.

It's pretty simple, just enter your name and it'll greet you. The poor thing has no choice. It requires node and express, but the zip includes the module for express so things should be fine.

The greetings are random and come from Wikipedia/me, the spinner was used in my lab and is there for fun purposes (or clearly JS is just too slow to respond at a reasonable pace).
